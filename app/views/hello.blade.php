    <p class="lead"> The goal of this project is to develop a simulation actor and connect to a database to connect a building energy management system to building simulation software and benchmark the performances and a restful API and connect to a database to connect a building energy management system to building simulation software and benchmark the performances.</p>
	<p class="lead"> Building simulation software allows expert users to accurately evaluate the energy performances of buildings. Coupling the building simulation environment with an advanced control system requires additional and specialised knowledge of both control development and building simulation software modelling. There is a gap between developers who build software controls for buildings (like home automation control systems) and building simulation software experts. The possibility to validate and benchmark sophisticated control algorithms on detailed building software models with a reduced modelling experience and knowledge could benefit building users, energy system designers and software engineers.</p>
    <p class="lead"> The objective is to develop a smart building test environment that will allow to compare and benchmark different control algorithms and store the results in a database a display comparison benchmark graphs.</p>
